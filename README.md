It was built with Next.js and many other React libraries.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Deploy on Vercel

I know the easiest way to deploy Next.js project is to Vercel. This project is live on [https://testing-react-typescript.vercel.app](https://testing-react-typescript.vercel.app).
